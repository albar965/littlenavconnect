Files in this directory:

=== littlemavmap.exe.manifest.RTM, littlemavmap.exe.manifest.SP1 and littlemavmap.exe.manifest.XPACK

These can be used to force Little Navmap or Little Navconnect to use a different version of SimConnect.
To use overwrite "littlenavmap.exe.manifest" with one of these files.

=== SimConnect.ini

This file can be used to diagnose SimConnect problems.

Change the path
"file=C:\Users\YOURUSERNAME\simconnect%03u.log"
in the file to point your home directory or desktop directory.

Then copy the file to your "Flight Simulator X Files" directory (or whatever simulator you use).
This is the directory where the flight plans are stored.

A console will open when the simulator is started and a simconnect.log is created.

Do not forget to remove the file after done with diagnostics.
